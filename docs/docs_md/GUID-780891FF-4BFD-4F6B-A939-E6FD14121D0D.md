|[MSD Host and HID Device](GUID-E80614F1-3AB2-4B1C-8D39-5B881F67CE36.md)|This application creates a USB Dual Role application that can switch between<br /> USB Host MSD Stack and USB Device HID function. The role switch is trigger by a<br /> switch press. In the USB Host mode, the application performs read and write<br /> operations to a USB pen drive. In the USB Device mode, the application emulates a<br /> HID mouse.|
